FortiGate Secure Remote access with Terraform.

# Deployment

> This script requires the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

1. Login to Azure with `az login`.<br>
2. Add your Client ID, Subscription ID and Tenant ID to the Terraform vars.tf.<br>
3. Adjust the `remote_subnet` and `remote_subnet_netmask` variables to that of your spoke FortiGate subnet range. The default value is `10.100.81.0`.
4. Run `terraform init`.<br>
5. Run `terraform apply`.<br>

To navigate to your deployed FortiGate use the Public IP address and the default admin port of 8443.

The default admin username and password can be found in vars.tf under `admin_name` and `admin_password`. <br>

<i>Note: <b>EasyKey</b> from the output will contain configuration that can be applied to Spoke VPN devices for ease of configuration. </i>

2. Enter a **Name** for the spoke.
3. For **Template type**, select `Hub-and-Spoke`.

### Authentication:

2. The Outgoing interface should adjust automatically based on the Remote IP address entered.
3. Enter the Pre-shared key. This can be found in the vars.tf file under `psk_key`.

For <i>EasyKey</i> setup, only the Pre-shared key needs to be entered.
